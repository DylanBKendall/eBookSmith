        <h4 class="glow-text">About Me</h4>
        <p>
          I am a software engineering student at Miami University. I aim to work in the field of artificial
          intelligence or machine learning. I mainly use Python, Java, and C++. I have built programs involving
          machine learning models to predict from datasets, along with an artificial intelligence pathfinding 
          program. I also like doing backend development. I built a program for purchasing baked goods and a 
          reminder app. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="glow-text">Project Role & Contributions</h4>
        <p>
          I helped develop a large portion of the frontend of the application. I helped develop and come up with
          key UI features such as the carousel, FAQ drop-down menu, the email submission, the footer, buttons, etc.
          I also did a lot of the bootstrap for the website. I created many media elements such as videos, content 
          of text, and images. I also helped with the placement and organization of the features. I handled a lot of 
          the HTML and CSS with some JavaScript in this project.
        </p>

        <h4 class="glow-text">Challenges & Solutions</h4>
        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges was trying to get CSS to work with everything. HTML was not difficult, but
          trying to get elements in a certain way sometimes was hard to figure out. At times, things would resize
          weirdly and it would because of a different part of the web page. It sometimes was hard to figure out what
          was wrong, however, with a lot of trial and error, along with research, I was able to figure out the CSS issues.
        </p>

        <h4 class="glow-text">Reflections</h4>
        <p>
          I think this project made me more confident in my skills as a developer. I was pretty lost on stuff like this.
          I am more of an AI person, so, before this project, I didn't do much front-end development. However, I realized
          that I can do it. With patience, research, and trial and error, I can be successful at stuff like this. I think
          I will use what I learned to advance into my future career.
