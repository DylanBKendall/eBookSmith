        <h4 class="glow-text">About Me</h4>
        <p>
          I’m a Computer Science and Software Engineering student at Miami University aiming to work in backend or game
          development. I have strong experience with Java, C++, and JavaScript, and a solid foundation in graphics, data
          structures, and full-stack development. Outside of class, I’ve built projects ranging from a custom
          OpenGL-based game engine to a mental health tracking iOS app and a seat notification system for students.
        </p>

        <h4 class="glow-text">Project Role & Contributions</h4>
        <p>
          I served as the primary backend and full-stack developer for eBookSmith. I handled nearly all JavaScript
          logic, built the eBook generation system in PHP, integrated the ChatGPT API for story/title generation, and
          implemented SQLite-based transaction logging. On the frontend, I developed the Forge and Library pages, built
          the dynamic navbar/footer system, and designed the site’s glowing theme and branding.
        </p>

        <h4 class="glow-text">Challenges & Solutions</h4>
        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges was getting the EPUB generation to work with valid XHTML content. I overcame
          this by researching formatting requirements and using AI tools to help generate clean markup. Styling tricky
          components like accordions also took time and experimentation to get just right—but the result was worth it.
        </p>

        <h4 class="glow-text">Reflections</h4>
        <p>
          Seeing the project come to life was incredibly rewarding. Clicking "Generate" and watching a prompt become a
          polished, downloadable story felt magical. I also learned that I genuinely enjoy making things look good—and
          that I'm good at it. I came away with more confidence in my frontend skills and my ability to figure out
          complex backend challenges under pressure.
