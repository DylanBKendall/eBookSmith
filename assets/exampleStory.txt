Detective Eli Mercer never missed a detail. Fourteen years on the force, a spotless record, and a mind like a scalpel. But none of that mattered the moment he opened the wrong door.

It started like any other Tuesday. Rain drizzled down the gray Manhattan skyline as Mercer leaned over the folder on his desk—another domestic stabbing in Queens. He sighed. The real criminals were getting smarter, and Mercer was tired of cleaning up after amateur bloodbaths. That’s when the call came in.

“Midtown homicide. Victim’s a state judge. Captain says you’re the closest.”

Mercer didn’t argue. He grabbed his coat and left his cold coffee behind.

The crime scene was a high-rise penthouse. A modern place with too much glass and not enough soul. The body of Judge Alden Remy lay sprawled across a white leather couch, throat slit ear to ear. Blood soaked through the cushions, and a letter opener gleamed on the coffee table—wiped clean.

"Who found him?" Mercer asked.

“Anonymous tip,” said Officer Perez, bagging evidence. “Came in thirty minutes ago. Call traced to a burner. No security footage. Cameras were disabled.”

Something itched in Mercer’s mind. A judge killed in his own home, the weapon wiped clean, a burner tip-off—it was staged. Too clean.

But what made the itch grow into a chill was what Perez said next.

“Dispatch says you were already on this case. You pulled the file yesterday.”

Mercer frowned. “No, I didn’t.”

He turned to the wall-mounted desk in the corner. The monitor was still on. A document sat open. His name in the header: Detective E. Mercer – Case Notes: Remy Homicide.

Mercer stepped back. “Someone's setting me up.”

Perez raised a brow. “You wanna run that by me again?”

“I never opened this case. Someone’s using my credentials.”

Before Perez could reply, the elevator dinged. Captain Morales stepped out with Internal Affairs in tow. Two men in suits flanked her.

“Eli,” she said tightly. “Turn around. Hands behind your head.”

“What the hell is this?”

“We have a witness statement placing you here an hour before the tip came in,” she said. “And your fingerprints are on the glass.”

Mercer stared at her, frozen. “I was in my office all morning.”

But he knew. The missing time. The coffee left untouched. Someone had been in his office, using his computer. Framing him.

He ran.

There was no plan—just instinct. He darted past a stunned Perez, through the side hallway, out a service stairwell. He heard Morales shout behind him, the thudding boots of IA agents not far behind.

By the time Mercer hit the alley behind the building, his lungs burned. His badge weighed heavy in his pocket, useless now. The system he trusted had turned on him.

The next hours blurred. A burner phone from a bodega. A change of clothes from a donation bin. He knew how to disappear—he’d hunted fugitives for over a decade. Now he was one.

He holed up in an abandoned office above a closed bookstore. Peeling paint, cracked windows, and a city that no longer looked like home. Mercer sat with the judge’s photo on a burner tablet, eyes scanning articles, decisions, court records.

That’s when he found it.

A corruption trial. A sealed case. Remy was presiding over a secret grand jury about police contractors involved in illegal surveillance. One name stood out: Ivor Tech—whose CEO had donated generously to the mayor’s reelection campaign.

Mercer’s last case had quietly unearthed evidence pointing to that same company. He hadn't made the connection until now.

Someone tied the loose ends together—then made sure Mercer became one.

Now, with half the NYPD looking for him, Mercer had to do what he’d never done before: stay in the shadows. Not to protect the city, but to survive long enough to expose the truth.

Because if he didn’t, the next door he opened might be his last.
